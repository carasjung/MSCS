 My only complaint is that when you put it on your face you need to hold the upper part of the container to keep it from turning when applying it. Mine turned and went back into the tube and I ended up scraping my face with the plastic part. ,,1,,,,,,0
 Scent reminds me of Clean & Clear Morning Burst. The products are actually pretty similar except for the price point and that this is a scrub/exfoliator. This also does feel lighter,,1,,,,,,0
 i received two sets through different orders and i am sold.,,1,,,,,,0

1. So expensive,,1,,,,,,0
1. gentle yet effective. Never left my face feeling raw,,1,,,,,,0
2. skin felt smooth after use,,1,,,,,,0
3. pores looked smaller bc they were decongested,,1,,,,,,0
4. love the fruity smell,,1,,,,,,0
5. combo it with the resurfacing mask and it left my skin looking radiant,,1,,,,,,0
;),,1,,,,,,0
After looking more into the ingredients and doing some research i realized why it stings! Which also got me into looking into chemical Peels,,1,,,,,,0
Also we do not use a clarisonic we use our hands its not super foamy that way but still effective,,1,,,,,,0
Always saves my skin when it is reactive.,,1,,,,,,0
And I have to give the brand some kudos on the packaging. The container almost feels like glass or porcelain and it almost feels like if I dropped it it would chip like porcelain. It definitely gives it a touch of elegance.,,1,,,,,,0
And the smell is so fresh!,,1,,,,,,0
At first I was worried about my face getting extra oily since it had an oily texture but this cleanser is just perfect. It melts off my makeup effortlessly and leaves my skin soft and clean. I don’t need a lot to remove all my makeup either so this will probably last me a really long time.,,1,,,,,,0
But I am a little disappointed in the packaging - the actual product is in a little chamber that is about 1/4 of the bottle shown in the picture. So you’re getting much less product than you’d think by just looking at the picture.,,1,,,,,,0
But even with that minor inconvenience I think this is my new go-to exfoliator.,,1,,,,,,0
CON,,1,,,,,,0
Con: I thought the packaging is a glass bottle but it is just plastic. It is expensive(even more expensive than Shu Uemura cleansing oil). I would only purchase it when there is promotion.,,1,,,,,,0
Counter Balance Oil Control Hydrator complimentary for testing purposes. This is my first time using a collection like this to develop a skincare routine. I love the smell. It’s minty and refreshing. This collection helped me to get back the glow I had when I was expecting. It’s lightweight and it doesn’t aggravate my skin.,,1,,,,,,0
DO NOT USE THIS EVERYDAY.,,1,,,,,,0

FRXXXTION Stick Exfoliating Cleanser in my January Sephora Play beauty box. This stick exfoliant effectively cleanses skin and pores. Gentle enough for daily use. This product is #fibromyalgia and #sensoryissues friendly. #justmyfriendlyopinion,,1,,,,,,0
For those who don’t like dipping their fingers in the jar pick up a few little plastic paddles to scoop out what you need. That is what I do :),,1,,,,,,0
Gotta be carefull with the eyes but it leave the skin super soft.,,1,,,,,,0
Great product!,,1,,,,,,0
Highly recommend this for all skin types because it’s non-drying!,,1,,,,,,0
Honestly I have had such good luck with all the DE products I tried.  I will continue to use this once a week and keep it on a little longer each time.,,1,,,,,,0
However the only downside is that it did leave my skin dry,,1,,,,,,0
I accidentally got some in my mouth and it tasted slightly sweet. Weird haha,,2306,,,,,,0
I also use their Deep Hydration Face Cream,,1,,,,,,0
I am absolutely repurchasing.,,1,,,,,,0
I am so glad that I got the chance to try a free sample from BzzAgent and I WILL be purchasing these in the future!,,1,,,,,,0
I am so happy I switched. Breakups are way down. My face doesn’t hurt or burn when I use this. I also haven’t had issues doing it since its super low maintenance cleanser. ,,1,,,,,,0
I can absolutely tell a difference in my skin since day 1. This cleanser worrrrkksss.,,1,,,,,,0
I definitely see a difference in my skin’s texture. Much smoother and overall healthier looking. Not nearly as dull as before. I gave it four stars because it’s not as brightening as I had hoped. ,,1,,,,,,0
I did receive this product for free from SK-II for my honest review.,,1,,,,,,0
I do have one sun spot and I was hoping this would help lighten it but so far it has not helped. So that is a bit disappointing for the price tag.,,1,,,,,,0
I do love masks. ,,1,,,,,,0
I don’t see or feel anything at all after using this mask.,,1,,,,,,0
I ended up buying a full sized product due to how much I love it. I love the strong smell of roses and I love the jelly texture of the mask. It’s very easy to apply and it’s very easy to rinse off. It’s definitely made my skin feel softer. ,,1,,,,,,0
I feel like it got really disappointed in Caudalie. How could they changed a good product to this? Have they tried it themselves? Money driven decision? i dont know,,1,,,,,,0
I have adult (30+) Combination skin and this does wonders. A little goes a logn way too! ,,1,,,,,,0
I have been using several brands of moisturizer and decided to try this one because of the mostly positive reviews.,,1,,,,,,0
I have been using this from a year and have gone down several tubes already,,1,,,,,,0
I have combination skin and am acne-prone; I got breakouts in the past that I now think were related to double-cleansing with more irritating cleansers (even “natural“ ones). ,,1,,,,,,0
I have combination skin with lots of blackheads and this mask is a new must have in my skin care routine.,,1,,,,,,0
I have not needed to buy eye makeup remover and feels like my lashes are better for it.,,1,,,,,,0
I have sensitive skin and it didn’t do me any favours. I really liked how gave me a deep clean though and was nice to use on warm evenings(I kept it in the fridge).,,1,,,,,,0
I have the issue with it making my eyes “foggy“ or blurry as well but seem to be able to mitigate most of that by adding a little water to my fingers and rubbing my eyes into more of an emulsion before rinsing.,,1,,,,,,0
I have to hide this from my boyfriend so he won’t use up all of it! I’m going to definitely be purchasing another for him.,,1,,,,,,0
I have used many cleaners over the years.  After trying this cleaner I can honestly say it is the Best!  It cleans your face and leaves it feeling clean and fresh.  You can definitely feel  and see the difference over time with this product.   My pores can’t be seen even with a magnifying mirror (and I am not young).,,1,,,,,,0
I highly recommend you get a sample and give this a try.,,1,,,,,,0
I keep buying it every time I run out of it because it works soooo good on my oily acne prone skin. Makes my skin feel fresh and helps with my acne and breaking out less often. Just love it :),,1,,,,,,0
I like how refreshing it feel after I wash the product out. My skin feels nice and clean! ^^,,1,,,,,,0
I like the smell but it’s useless.,,1,,,,,,0
I like the texture and the fact that it is fragrance free.,,1,,,,,,0
I liked the texture and smell of the product however after 2 weeks of use I found that I had lost significant moisture from my skin.,,1,,,,,,0
I love the packaging of this whole line! The matte green color is simple and beautiful ,,1,,,,,,0
I love using this in the shower too!,,1,,,,,,0
I normally find no visible benefits with masks. However after one use I noticed a difference. Fresher looking skin with blackheads diminishing.,,1,,,,,,0
I now use this weekly to prep my skin for a chemical peel a day or two before. I love the results that it has given my oily acne prone skin!,,1,,,,,,0
I only saw one reviewer who mentioned this so it may be a rare side effect. I did not notice a smell for this one but I prefer non fragrant moisturizers so it does not upset my  skin.,,1,,,,,,0
I put it on for ten min last night to test it and found it does tingle.  I didn’t want to chance leaving it on longer the first time just in case.  After taking it off I used the Marula oil from the sample.  OH MY GOD my skin was so baby soft!  I woke up this morning and my skin still glowed.  ,,1,,,,,,0
I put on a little bit at bed time and in the morning my lips are smooth and soft. I will definitely be buying the full size.,,1,,,,,,0
I really like this cleanser as it is very gentle and seems to remove the oil of my skin without being overly drying like other products I ve tried before.,,1,,,,,,0
I really liked the formula going from a solid to a more liquified oil and then to a milky cleanser. I felt that you wasted far less product than with liquid removers that you have to place on cotton pads. This will also travel well and shouldn’t be a problem on an airline! I am thrilled to not have to worry about the remover leaking. Its a great product and a brilliant innovation.,,1,,,,,,0
I really love the mint smell.,,1,,,,,,0
I received a sample size and I wish they sold as a trial/travel size :),,1,,,,,,0
I received it for free for testing purposes and didn’t expect I’ll love it so much.,,1,,,,,,0

I received this product to test and review for free by INFLUENSTER. all opinions are 100% my own. #oleglow,,1,,,,,,0
I sometimes use this as a spot treatment.,,1,,,,,,0
I store them upside down so that the top ones have product on them just like the rest of them. They seemed to be drier if I didn’t. I will keep using them and hopefully give them 5 stars in another month. I’m almost finished with my first jar.,,1,,,,,,0
I suggest you get a sample first although it is very well reviewed and highly rated and relatively inexpensive compared to other masks. I so badly wanted to like this product! Its raved about so much but I cannot.,,1,,,,,,0
I tested this product for free from SK-II,,1,,,,,,0
I typically use another alcohol-free toner and it’s much more gentle on my skin. I think this is much more suited for oily skin in general.,,1,,,,,,0
I was skeptical at first because it stinged very badly to the point where i would wash it off right away. ,,1,,,,,,0
I was thrilled to find PTR had one almost identical and,,1,,,,,,0
I will definitely be purchasing the full size as soon as the sample runs out.,,1,,,,,,0
I wish it was a creamier consistency for application.,,1,,,,,,0
I would not recommend this cleanser for individuals with acne-prone skin.,,1,,,,,,0
I would say it lasts a good 24 hours without make-up. Can’t say what it’s like with make-up because I rarely wear the stuff.,,1,,,,,,0
If you want to put a gel on your skin for 10 minutes that smells good - go for it.,,1,,,,,,0
Influenster sent me this for free.,,1,,,,,,0
It did not work for my skin. My skin is very dry and flaky and I have hormonal acne and constant outbreaks on my chin area. ,,1,,,,,,0
It does a good job taking off my face makeup. I have to go in with cotton/makeup eraser for my eye area a little afterwards (to be expected),,1,,,,,,0
It does go on heavy and is greasy UNTIL it penetrates the skin overnight.  But when you wake up and feel how smooth and supple your skin feels it is worth it.,,1,,,,,,0
It does not make your skin feel tight afterwards.,,1,,,,,,0
It doesn’t beat my Boscia charcoal mask because that mask doesn’t dry my skin out.  While this mask is good it did dry me out on my cheeks and chin.  But awesome for my breaks.,,1,,,,,,0
It dries your face out a lot but the results are worth it,,1,,,,,,0
It has no smell to it and it doesn’t make me break out. It takes off all of my make up..it’s a really great cleanser for people with very sensitive skin...(tried boscia charcoal cleanser - never again),,1,,,,,,0
It is a very easy product to use that left me with the cooling sensation not only while it was on but also after I removed it. I could see the change in my color right away and am loving using all 10 of the masks that came in the box!,,1,,,,,,0
It is not exfoliating.,,1,,,,,,0
It is not necessary one of the stated benefits but it really cleared my skin right up--dried up any acne and made my skin feel pretty nice. For that reason alone I will keep using it and probably repurchase it---it is way more effective than other acne treatments for me. ,,1,,,,,,0
Its a must have! Try the smaller size if you dont want to invest in the bigger size to try...Youw ill not regreat it!!!,,1,,,,,,0
It’s very depressing.,,1,,,,,,0
I’m 62 years old with OK skin but this product really did lift off dead skin and left my face silky smooth and not at all dried out - it also minimized very visible pores.  This is IT for me forever.,,1,,,,,,0
I’m not sure if it’s this lotion on it’s own or a combination of steps in my skincare routine that’s giving me the results. Either way I will keep using it!,,1,,,,,,0
I’ve had it for over 2 months. I wash my face day and night. ,,1,,,,,,0

Leaves my skin really nice and refreshed.,,1,,,,,,0
My detailed review is below.,,1,,,,,,0
My first experience with this cream was when I was in a law enforcement academy and we were pepper sprayed as part of the academy.  The pepper spray is military grade and left burn marks down my cheeks.  I had this cream as a sample and it cured the burns within 3 days and I had no scarring.,,1,,,,,,0
My go to product for blemish/acne/spots treatment. I don`t have acne prone skin so I only use this when i get random breakouts. Works very well! I can`t say it works immediately but with its help I usually get rid of breakouts whithin 1-2 days.,,1,,,,,,0
My husband even started using it and his face has never looked better he usually gets a lot of dead skin around his nose but is somehow is still very oily; but no more ! This stuff Im telling you is for anyone. ,,1,,,,,,0
My mother who is 84 years old also uses this mask and she looks amazing her skin has a beautiful soft glow..,,1,,,,,,0
My second experience with this cream was during my laser tattoo removal.  Laser burns are painful and can blister and scab.  After the first treatment I did not use this cream and it took the area 3 weeks to heal.  After my second treatment I used this cream and the area healed in 1 week.,,1,,,,,,0
My skin is very oily and this cleanser is a miracle for me!,,1,,,,,,0
No such issues with this cleanser--my skin is the best it’s ever been!,,1,,,,,,0
None of the “balls“ are actually skin.  It is the chemical compounds sticking together.  My skin looks and feels the same.,,1,,,,,,0
OBSESSED!,,1,,,,,,0
Overall: This product is a STAPLE and MUST Have in my routine!! I always go back to this one. I even converted my boyfriend that is now a Fresh addict.,,1,,,,,,0

PROS,,1,,,,,,0
Pro: It is a good product and delivers what I expect from a makeup remover. It removes makeup and leaves skin clean and soft. It does not leave residual or dehydrate skin. ,,1,,,,,,0
Really a nice mask.,,1,,,,,,0
Returned it!,,1,,,,,,0
Returned it.,,1,,,,,,0
Since using the stick my skin feels cleaner and for longer periods of time and I have not seen a single breakout on my face. I have already ordered the full sized one!,,1,,,,,,0
Skin type; extremely oily and somewhat sensitive.,,1,,,,,,0
So great. I instantly look like I slept 3 extra hours :),,1,,,,,,0
So if you’re looking for a good charcoal mask try this one by Origins.,,1,,,,,,0
Stay caution if you have sensitive eyes.,,1,,,,,,0
Still find this the best.,,1,,,,,,0
Still love this product and will continue to purchase when I run out.,,1,,,,,,0
Thank you Fresh,,1,,,,,,0
Thank you Influenster for letting me try this face set for FREE!,,1,,,,,,0
The consistency is slightly thick.  A little product goes a long way so start with a dime-size of product on your finger tips and use more if required.  I wouldn’t recommend this for people with oily skin since it is a bit on the thicker side.  I’ll typically avoid applying this to my forehead since it is a bit on the oily side up there.,,1,,,,,,0
The product itself is pearly white which is so pretty! Very silky on the skin. No scent and doesn’t aggravate my sensitive skin.,,1,,,,,,0
The sent is very light and fades after some time and does and does not feel oil or greasy which is why I often do not like lotions.,,1,,,,,,0
The smell is very nice too not overpowering and kinda fresh and natural.,,1,,,,,,0
The smell was a little too strong for me; smells like jell-o.,,1,,,,,,0
The texture is a mousse- cool to the touch and feels very luxurious when put on.  I use this mask whenever I feel my skin needs a little TLC.,,1,,,,,,0
This cleanser is so soft and creamy and I refuse to use anything else!,,1,,,,,,0
This cream is truly healing and restorative.  I highly recommend it if you have dry skin or some type of skin issue.,,1,,,,,,0
This face wash is very gentle and does NOT dry out my skin! I feel like a layer of weight is lifted after I wash my face with it. ,,1,,,,,,0
This felt like it would not absorb into my skin. It sat on top and felt very greasy and hours after applying I would touch my face and my fingertips would be shiny and greasy. ,,1,,,,,,0
This is gentle and great for dry skin.  Will definitely repurchase.,,1,,,,,,0
This is what you’ve been looking for!,,1,,,,,,0
This mask clears up the redness immediately. Highly recommend,,1,,,,,,0
This mask really works and leaves my skin very smooth! I have now purchased it a second time,,1,,,,,,0
This mask was cooling and didn’t have a harsh smell. It made my skin feel soft and supple. I will be repurchasing!,,1,,,,,,0
